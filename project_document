    - Fetched data from different urls, and then applied some data cleaning operaions.
    
      => Data Cleaning Operaions:
        - lower case the data.
        - removing special characters like '"' .
        - remove every thing except [a-zA-Z].
        - remove stopwords and perform lemmatization.
    
    - Stored the cleaned data in a local dataframe named as "dataframe" by converting the data in dataframe and concatenated with a local dataframe created.
    - Sort the dataframe itself every time you CONCAT new data in it.(Because our final objective is "To store the categorized data".
    - save the dataframe to mysql database using sqlAlchamy.
